## Introduction

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Creating a Vite Project

To create a new Vite project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app
```

In the above command, `my-vite-app` is the name of your new project. Replace it with any desired name for your project. By default, this command sets up a Vite project with JavaScript.

### Choosing a Specific Template

Vite allows choosing different templates for your project. When creating a new project, you can specify the desired template using the `--template` option. Here are some examples:

Select a template by: `react`, `vue` & `lit`.
```bash
# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template [template]
```

Choose the template that best suits your needs and adjust the project name as needed.

### Understanding the Difference Between JavaScript and TypeScript

When you choose JavaScript, Vite configures the project with default JavaScript settings. On the other hand, when choosing TypeScript, Vite configures the project with TypeScript settings, including generating a `tsconfig.json` file.

## Configuring Port 80

Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic. To host a Vite app on Square Cloud, configure the use of port 80. In Vite, you can set the `--port 80` parameter in the startup script to ensure your app runs correctly on this port.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the `START` field is essential to customize the startup command. If you want to build and start your Vite app on Square Cloud, configure the `START` field as follows:

```app squarecloud.app
START=npm run build && npm run serve
```

This command will execute the "build" and "serve" scripts defined in your `package.json`:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-vite-app",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview --port 80"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.1.4"
  }
}

```
## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a Vite website?** Don't worry, we're here to help. Vite is a modern front-end build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It's designed to provide out-of-the-box support for ES modules, enabling instant server start-up and hot module replacement. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **1vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most Vite websites. However, if you're working on a larger project or need more stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can ensure smooth performance even under high demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Your App to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, package your application files into a zip file where the configuration file is, and upload the website on [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload). Remember not to include files like `node_modules`. You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your app hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer using a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
      The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website or API is 512MB, however, when building your site directly on Square, it's advisable to use a higher amount, or you may encounter the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporarily Denied Access" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.
