## Introduction
This tutorial will have you deploying a PHP app to Square Cloud in minutes.

This tutorial assumes that you already have a [Square Cloud account](https://squarecloud.app/login) and PHP installed locally.

## Required Files
Make sure your project includes the following files:

- Your main PHP file.
- `composer.json` (*optional dependency file).
- [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) (a file containing your Square Cloud configuration).

## Preparing Files for Upload
Before you can host your project on Square Cloud, ensure your project files are correctly configured for hosting.

Create your [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) configuration file.

If your project includes a `composer.json` file, Square Cloud will automatically install dependencies using Composer. However, if your project also has Node dependencies (i.e., a `package.json` file), you should specify the installation process in the `START` field of your `squarecloud.app` file. For example:

```plaintext
START=npm install && php .....
```

If your project lacks a `composer.json` file, it will be initialized by executing the following command: `php -S 0.0.0.0:80`, which will start a web server.

# Uploading Files to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.
Access the [Square Cloud Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project files.
