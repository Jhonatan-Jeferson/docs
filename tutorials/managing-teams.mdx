## Introduction

- Before you start, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have a plan superior to the `Hobby` plan active on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## Requirements

- The only requirement to use the team system is to have a plan higher than the `Hobby` plan.

## Creating Your Team

To create your team, you should go to the [dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard), click on your profile and choose the "Create a Team" option. Finally, just choose the name of your team and confirm. Thus, it will be created and you can access it by selecting your profile again and choosing the desired team.

## Roles
Each member in the team has a certain role that provides specific permissions to be performed on the applications. Below you can see a list of permissions:

  <Accordion title="View" icon="eye">
  Can view panels, metrics, logs and system alerts to monitor the overall integrity and performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manager" icon="user-tie">
    In addition to viewing permissions, you can control the lifecycle of applications by starting, stopping, and restarting services.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintain" icon="wrench">
    Beyond manager permissions, you can upload, download, and edit files and application settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Admin" icon="user-shield">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
