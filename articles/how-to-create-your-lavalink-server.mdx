## Creating the application.yml

Create a configuration file for your Lavalink server. You can access an example file [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example).

<Warning>Set the `port` field in your `application.yml` file to: `80`.</Warning>

## Enhancing Security

It is highly recommended to configure a secure password in the `password` field of your configuration file (application.yml). We recommend using a password with at least 32 characters.

<Note>It is important to remember that you must use port 443 (SSL) and the `secure` option in `true` to connect to your lavalink.</Note>

Create a compressed file (.zip) containing the Lavalink.jar and application.yml. Then, upload your configuration file to Square Cloud.

By following these steps, you"ll have your Lavalink server up and running smoothly on Square Cloud. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, don"t hesitate to reach out to our [support team](../company/support).
