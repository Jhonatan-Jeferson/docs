    In JavaScript, you can use the `Date` object and the `toLocaleString` method to change the timezone:

```javascript index.js
// Create a Date object
const date = new Date();

// Convert the date to a string using a specific timezone
const dateString = date.toLocaleString("pt-BR", {timeZone: "America/Sao_Paulo"});

console.log(dateString);  // Outputs the date and time in the "America/Sao_Paulo" timezone
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    In Python, you can use the `datetime` library to change the timezone:

```python main.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a datetime object
now = datetime.now()

# Create a timedelta object to represent the timezone difference
time_difference = timedelta(hours=-3) # The timezone difference between UTC and "America/Sao_Paulo" is -3 hours
# Change the timezone
time = now + time_difference

print(time) # Outputs the date and time in the "America/Sao_Paulo" timezone
```
  </Tab>
