## Introduction

Hosting your website or API on Square Cloud is a breeze with the squarecloud.app configuration file. This file allows you to customize and configure your application with essential parameters like the main file, memory allocation, version, display name, and more.

## Creating the squarecloud.app configuration File
To get started, create your [squarecloud.app](how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file) configuration file in the root directory of your project.

### Important website parameters
The **website port** needs to be **80**, if you are using a static website, you don't need to set the `START` parameter.

In squarecloud.app configuration file:
- `SUBDOMAIN`: If you are hosting a website, set this parameter to your desired subdomain.
- `START`: A custom startup command (if needed).


<Note>Website url will be: `my-subdomain-parameter`.squareweb.app</Note>
```systemd This example host a website without custom startup command
MAIN=index.html
MEMORY=512
VERSION=recommended
DISPLAY_NAME=My simple static website!
SUBDOMAIN=mysite-simple-website
```

```systemd This example use all parameters and custom startup command in a website
MAIN=index.js
MEMORY=512
VERSION=recommended
DISPLAY_NAME=My simple nextjs website!
SUBDOMAIN=mysite-nextjs-website
START=npm run build && npm run start
```
