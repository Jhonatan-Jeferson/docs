## Creating a New Flask Project

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't already have them, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and [official Pip website](https://pypi.org/).

With Python and pip installed, you can create a new Flask project. First, install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Then, create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and add the following code to create a basic Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

In the above code, we create a basic route that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed. The application is configured to run on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic.

## Managing Dependencies with the requirements.txt File

The `requirements.txt` file is a file that lists all external libraries required for your project. You should list all libraries your project will use, excluding native libraries like `random` and `datetime`. This file should be included when submitting your application to Square Cloud.
```txt requirements.txt
flask
```
## Creating the squarecloud.app config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and is only necessary if you are using a custom script to start the website. In the example provided, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Uploading your project to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, package your application files into a zip file where the configuration file is and upload the site on [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload). Remember to include the `requirements.txt` file, but do not include files like `__pycache__`. You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to Set Up Your Custom Domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your Flask website, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary Access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, please wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.
