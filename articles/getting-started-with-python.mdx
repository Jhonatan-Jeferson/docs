## üöÄ Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Python on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating the squarecloud config file

  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to
  configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description,
  version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## üìÅ Preparing Project for Upload

After creating the configuration file, you need to create a zip file that includes the configuration file (`squarecloud.app/.config`) along with the files of your application.

## üñ•Ô∏è Preparing Your Python Project

### üìÅ Essential Configuration Files

When preparing your Python project for deployment on Square Cloud, ensure that you include your configuration file (`squarecloud.app/.config`) and the essential files of your application in a zip file.

<Warning>The configuration (`squarecloud.app/.config`) file must be located in the root of the zip file. Otherwise, Square Cloud will not be able to find it during deployment.</Warning>

#### üóëÔ∏è Files to Exclude Before Uploading

- `ffmpeg`: This software is pre-installed in the Square Cloud environment, so there's no need to include this folder in your project.
- `.venv`: This folder contains the virtual environment for your project. Square Cloud provides an isolated environment, so this folder is not required.
- `pyproject.toml`: While this file defines build system requirements and dependencies, Square Cloud uses `requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- `poetry.lock`: Since Square Cloud does not currently support Poetry, this file should be excluded to avoid any potential issues during deployment.

### ü§î Why Exclude These Files?

Excluding `ffmpeg`, `.venv`, `pyproject.toml`, and `poetry.lock` is important for several reasons:

1. **Clean Environment:** Square Cloud creates a fresh environment for your project. Including these files is unnecessary and could lead to conflicts with the cloud environment's configurations.

2. **Efficiency:** Removing these files reduces the size of your upload, making the process faster and more streamlined.

3. **Compatibility:** Excluding `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` ensures that there are no compatibility issues, as Square Cloud relies on `requirements.txt` for installing dependencies.

Before uploading, make sure to zip your project files in **.zip** format, excluding the unnecessary files mentioned above. This will help ensure that your Python application is ready for a successful deployment to Square Cloud.

### üìÑ Required Files

- main.py (Example of main file).
- [requirements.txt](./how-to-create-your-requirements) (Dependency file).
- [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) (file that contains the Square Cloud configuration).

## üí° Troubleshooting

  <Accordion
    title="The main file is invalid or corrupted"

    This error occurs when the file defined as "main" for your application in
    the configuration file does not exist, is written incorrectly, or the path
    is incorrect. If your main file is inside a folder, for example, you should
    enter `folder/file.js`.

  <Accordion title="Bad Memory" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a bot is 256MB, and for a
    website/API, it's 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of
    your application, it may be advisable to allocate a larger amount of RAM to
    avoid the
    [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM)
    error.

## üì§ Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
