## Introduction

To configure your domain, you need to have the Senior plan or higher. You can purchase it on various domain registration platforms like:

- [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com.br/)
- [Registro.br](https://registro.br/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/)
- [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/)
- [Name.com](https://www.name.com/)

Choose a platform that suits your needs and purchase your domain.

## Configuring DNS:

- Access the website where you purchased your domain, such as [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com.br/) or [Registro.br](https://registro.br/).
- Next, go to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/), navigate to "WebSites," and click on "Add a site," as shown in this ![image](https://i.imgur.com/AwL5pTi.png).
- After entering your domain, copy the provided nameservers and paste them on the website where you purchased the domain, in the DNS/Nameservers section.

## Configuring the Domain on Square Cloud

- Choose the site you want to configure the domain for in the [dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard), then go to the **Network** option and enter your ![domain](https://i.imgur.com/XqbKn7v.png) in place of "example.com."
- Now that the domain is configured on Square Cloud, go back to Cloudflare, select your domain, and choose the ![DNS](https://i.imgur.com/CTu7oFB.png) option.
- Finally, point your domain to "custom.squarecloud.app" with the type "CNAME," following exactly as ![shown](https://i.imgur.com/yc9Nyty.png), replacing the "name" with your domain.
