# Square Cloud Documentation

Welcome to the squarecloud.app  Documentation! This documentation provides detailed information on how to interact with the squarecloud.app to manage and deploy your applications on the Square Cloud platform.

Using the Mintlify documentation framework, we have created a simple and easy to use documentation site. The documentation site is available at [https://docs.squarecloud.app](https://docs.squarecloud.app).

# Test Local
Is this your first time running the documentation site locally? If so, you will need to install the Mintlify CLI.

```bash
npm install mintlify --global
```

Once you have installed the Mintlify CLI, you can run the documentation site locally using the following command:
```bash
mintlify dev
```
