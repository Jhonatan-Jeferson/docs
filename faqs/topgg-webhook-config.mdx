---

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have an approved bot on [top.gg](https://top.gg/) and are using either Node.js or Python for your project.

## Setting Up the Environment

**For Node.js users:**

1. Start a new Node.js project with the following command:

```bash Terminal
npm init -y
```

This command creates a package.json file in the current directory.

2. Install the necessary libraries:

```bash Terminal
npm install @top-gg/sdk express
```

**For Python users:**
1. Ensure you have Python and Pip (a package manager for Python) installed on your system. If not, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and the [official Pip website](https://pypi.org/).
2. Install the `flask` and `waitress` libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
pip install waitress
```

## Setting Up the Project

**1. Get your webhook authentication:**

  - Go to your Top.gg profile [here](https://top.gg/user/me).
  - Click "edit" on the bot you want to receive notifications for votes.
  - Under "GENERAL", choose the "webhook" option.
  - Set the webhook authentication in "Authorization". In this example, we used "myappsquare".

**2. Implement the webhook listener:**

The following sections provide code examples for both Javascript and Python:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Javascript">
    We will use the example provided by the top.gg documentation [here](https://docs.top.gg/docs/Libraries/javascript), with some modifications.

```javascript index.js
// Import libraries
const Topgg = require("@top-gg/sdk");
const express = require("express");

// Create Express app and Top.gg webhook instances
const app = express();
const webhook = new Topgg.Webhook("YOUR_AUTHORIZATION");

// Define route for '/topgg' endpoint (POST requests)
app.post("/topgg", webhook.listener((vote) => {
  // Log vote received message with user ID
  console.log(`Vote received successfully! User ID: ${vote.user}`);
}));

// Start server on port 80 (default HTTP)
app.listen(80);
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    For Python, you can use the following code:

```python app.py
# Import the necessary libraries
import logging
import json
from waitress import serve
from flask import Flask, request, abort

# Create an instance of the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define your authorization token
AUTH_TOKEN = 'YOUR_AUTHORIZATION'

# Define a route for the '/topgg' endpoint that accepts POST requests
@app.route("/topgg", methods=["POST"])
def hook():
    # Check the authorization header
    auth = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if auth != AUTH_TOKEN:
        logging.error('Access denied')
        abort(401)  # Unauthorized

    # Convert the request data from bytes to a JSON dictionary
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    # Print the ID of the user who voted
    print(f'Vote received successfully! User ID: {data["user"]}')
    # Return a response with the string "Data received" and status 200 to indicate that the request was processed successfully
    return "Data received"

# Check if this script is being run directly and not imported as a module
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set the log message format to exclude the log level
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
    # Serve our Flask app on port 80 and listen on all network interfaces
    serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=80)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

# Managing Dependencies with requirements.txt and package.json Files

## The requirements.txt File

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the external libraries required for your Python project. You should list all the libraries your project will use, excluding the native libraries. This file should be included when submitting your application to Square Cloud.

Just like the `package.json` is used to manage dependencies in Node.js projects, the `requirements.txt` is used for the same purpose in Python projects. It helps ensure that all environments where your app runs have the same versions of the required libraries, which helps avoid compatibility issues.

## The package.json File

The `package.json` file lists all the external libraries required for your Node.js project. You should list all the libraries your project will use, excluding the native libraries. This file should be included when submitting your application to Square Cloud.

### Conclusion

In both cases, these files make it easy for other developers to set up the environment to run your app, as they can install all dependencies at once using these files.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Uploading Your Application to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, put your application files into a zip file, including the configuration file, and upload it to the site at [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload).

If your application is a Node.js project, remember to include the `package.json` file, but do not include folders or files like `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`.

If your application is a Python project, remember to include the `requirements.txt` file, but do not include folders or files like `__pycache__` or `.pyc` files.

You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to Set Up Your Custom Domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your project, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary Access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, please wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.

## Starting Tests

If you have done everything correctly, try accessing your site using the subdomain defined in the configuration file. If you defined it as "mysite", to access it will be `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. After you access and only "Cannot GET /" or "Method Not Allowed" appears, everything is okay.

Now, you need to go back to the previous page where the authorization was defined. In the Webhook URL field, you should put the URL of your site with the route that will receive the votes.

- For the JavaScript code we created with `app.post("/topgg", webhook.listener((vote) => {...})`, the route that will receive the votes is "/topgg". So, if your website is "https://mysite.squareweb.app", you should put "https://mysite.squareweb.app/topgg" as the Webhook URL.

- For the Python code we created with `@app.route("/topgg", methods=["POST"])`, the route that will receive the votes is also "/topgg". So, the Webhook URL would be the same "https://mysite.squareweb.app/topgg".

</Frame>

Finally, click on the "Send Test" button. After that, check the terminal. If everything went well, the message you defined in `console.log` or `print` should appear in the terminal.

And with that, if everything has been configured correctly, your webhook will be ready to send notifications when your bot receives a vote on top.gg.
