## Creating a New Vue Project

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Creating a Vue Project

To create a new Vue project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

In this command, `npm create vue@latest` is used to create a new Vue project with the latest version of Vue. The `npm create` command is a tool that comes with `npm`, the Node.js package manager. It is used to initialize a new or existing npm package.

`vue@latest` is a package available on the npm registry that sets up a new Vue project for you. It takes care of all the initial setup, such as creating the project directory, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring basic files.

`@latest` is a tag specifying that you want to use the latest version of the `vue` package. This ensures you're always using the most updated version and, consequently, have access to the latest features.

## Configuring Port 80

Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic. To host a Vite app on Square Cloud, configure the use of port 80. In Vite, you can set the `--port 80` parameter in the startup script to ensure your app runs correctly on this port.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the `START` field is essential to customize the startup command. If you want to build and start your Vite app on Square Cloud, configure the `START` field as follows:

```app squarecloud.app
START=npm run build && npm run serve
```

This command will execute the "build" and "serve" scripts defined in your `package.json`:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "vue-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview --port 80"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^3.4.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-vue": "^5.0.4",
    "vite": "^5.2.8"
  }
}
```

## Uploading Your App to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, place your Vite app files inside the zip file where the configuration file is, and upload the site at [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload). Remember not to include files like `node_modules`. You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your app hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer using a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
      The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB, however, when building your site directly on Square, it's advisable to use a higher amount, or you may encounter the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporarily Denied Access" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.
