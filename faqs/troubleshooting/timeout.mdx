## When does it occur and how to resolve it?

- There are 4 situations that can result in this message when trying to access a website/API:

1. Your website or API may have errors preventing it from responding properly.

2. If the website or API is offline, you will also receive this message. It's important to check the logs to identify any potential errors.

3. In Square Cloud, the default port for websites and APIs is port `80` for HTTP traffic. If your website or API is using a different port, you may encounter this error message.

4. If you do not correctly configure the host as `0.0.0.0` when hosting your site, this can lead to access errors.
