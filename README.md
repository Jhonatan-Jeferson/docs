# Square Cloud Documentation

Welcome to the squarecloud.app  Documentation! This documentation provides detailed information on how to interact with the squarecloud.app to manage and deploy your applications on the Square Cloud platform.

Using the Mintlify documentation framework, we have created a simple and easy to use documentation site. The documentation site is hosted on the Square Cloud platform and is available at [https://docs.squarecloud.app](https://docs.squarecloud.app).
