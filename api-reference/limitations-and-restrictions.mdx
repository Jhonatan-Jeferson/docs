## API Limits
<Warning>Illegal or abusive use of our API may result in your account being blocked.</Warning>
<Warning>If you are rate limited, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. If you receive this response, you should wait **15 minutes before making another request**. </Warning>

The API is subject to rate limits (subject to change). The current rate limits are:

It is important to note that these API usage limits are set to ensure that the Square Cloud platform can be used equitably by all users and to protect the integrity of the systems. If you need more requests per minute or other broader limitations, it may be possible to upgrade to a higher tier plan that offers these additional features.
