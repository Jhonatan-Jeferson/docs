## Setting Up Your Discord Bot

Before you start coding, you need to set up your bot properly on Discord. First, it's necessary to have a Discord account. If you don't have one yet, you can create one by visiting the [official Discord website](https://discord.com/).
Sure, here's the revised text:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting Started" icon="rocket" iconType="solid">
    First, go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on "New Application". Next, you will need to choose a name for your bot and click on "Create" to create it.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting the Token" icon="key" iconType="solid">
    After creating your bot, it's time to get the token. To do this, you should go to the "Bot" tab and click on "Reset Token", thus generating your token. Finally, just copy it to use it in your code later.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/articles/discord/getting-the-token.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Activating Privileged Intents" icon="message" iconType="solid">
    Now that you already have your bot's token, you need to activate the message content intent. To do this, you should still be in the "Bot" tab, scroll down and look for "Privileged Gateway Intents" and activate "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT". This intent is necessary for the code example we will give, it serves for your bot to access the content of the messages. Without this intent, your bot will not be able to read the messages sent on the Discord server.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Warning>Remember to keep your bot's token secret as it can be used to control your bot.</Warning>

## Creating a New Discord Bot with Python (discord.py)

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the discord.py library using pip:

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

3. Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and add the following code to create a basic Discord bot:

```python main.py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'{client.user}')

@client.command()
async def hello(ctx):
    await ctx.reply('Hello!')

client.run('your token here')
```

4. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all external libraries needed for your project:

```txt requirements.txt
discord.py
```

## Creating a New Discord Bot with JavaScript (discord.js)

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`. This will create a new `package.json` file for your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Install the discord.js library using npm:

```bash
npm install discord.js
```

4. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) and add the following code to create a basic Discord bot:

```javascript index.js
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require("discord.js");

const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
  ],
});

client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log(`${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on("messageCreate", (message) => {
  if (message.content === "!hello") {
    message.reply("Hello!");
  }
});

client.login("your token here");
```

## Creating the Configuration File on Square Cloud

Square Cloud requires a specific configuration file to host your application. You can access our step-by-step guide on how to create one:
[How to Create Your Square Cloud Configuration File](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file)

## Configuring the START Field
<Warning>Only use this field if you are really sure about what you are doing.</Warning>

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and only needed if you are using a custom script to start the bot. In the provided example, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Uploading Your Application to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, package your application files into a zip file where the configuration file is and upload the bot at [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload). Remember to include the `requirements.txt` or `package.json` file, but do not include files like `__pycache__` or `node_modules`. You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-file-deletion-when-deploying-an-application-on-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-file-deletion-when-deploying-an-application-on-squarecloud).

## Testing the Bot

If you've done everything correctly, the next step is to invite your bot for testing. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Access the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select your bot.
3. Navigate to the "OAuth2" tab.
4. Go to "OAuth2 URL Generator".
5. Check the "bot" option.
6. Choose the permissions your bot will have if it's invited using this invite.
7. Below the permissions, an invite link for your bot will be generated. It should look something like this:
```txt
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=00000000000000&permissions=8&scope=bot
```

Remember, the `client_id` in the URL should be replaced with your bot's actual client ID. The `permissions` value may also need to be adjusted based on the permissions you want your bot to have.

Now, to test if everything is working, execute the following command on your server: `!hello`.
