## Introduction
This tutorial will have you deploying a Java app to Square Cloud in minutes.

The tutorial assumes that you have a [Square Cloud account](https://squarecloud.app/login), and that you have [Java](https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp) installed locally.

## Required Files
- project.jar (Example of a project file).
- MANIFEST.MF (Example of a manifest file).
- [squarecloud.app](./how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file) (file that contains the Square Cloud configuration).

## Preparing Files for Upload
Before hosting your project on Square Cloud, you must first have the files of your project properly configured, so that you can host it later.

Create your [squarecloud.app](./how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file) configuration file.

After the files of your project are ready just zip them in **.zip** format before uploading to Square Cloud.

# Uploading Files to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.
Access the [Square Cloud Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project files.
