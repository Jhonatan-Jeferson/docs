## Creating a New Django Project

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't already have them, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and [official Pip website](https://pypi.org/).

With Python and pip installed, you can create a new Django project. First, install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

Then, create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and add the following code to create a basic Django application:

```python app.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.urls import path
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

# Basic Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=False,  # Turn off debug mode
    SECRET_KEY='mysecretkey',  # Set your secret key
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*'],  # Allow all hosts for simplicity
    ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,  # Set the root URL configuration to this module
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=(),  # Use an empty tuple to disable middleware
)

# Simple view
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")  # Return a simple HTTP response

# URL configuration
urlpatterns = [
    path('', index),  # Map the root URL to the index view
]

# WSGI application
application = get_wsgi_application()

# WSGI server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    httpd = make_server('', 80, application)  # Serve the application using the WSGI server on port 80
    print("Django server running on port 80...")
    httpd.serve_forever()  # Start the server
```

In the above code, we create a basic route that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed. The application is configured to run on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic.

## Managing Dependencies with the requirements.txt file

The `requirements.txt` file is a file that lists all external libraries required for your project. You should list all libraries your project will use, excluding native libraries like `random` and `datetime`. This file should be included when submitting your application to Square Cloud.

```txt requirements.txt
django
```

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-create-your-squarecloud-configuration-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and is only necessary if you are using a custom script to start the website. In the example provided, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Uploading your project to Square Cloud

After following all the steps, package your application files into a zip file where the configuration file is and upload the site on [Upload](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload). Remember to include the `requirements.txt` file, but do not include files like `__pycache__`. You can get more information about unnecessary files when hosting at [automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-squarecloud).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to Set Up Your Custom Domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/articles/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your Django website, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary Access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, please wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.
