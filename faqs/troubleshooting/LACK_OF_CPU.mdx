## When does it occur?

This issue occurs when your application is using more CPU than is available.

```bash
[SQUARE-SHIELD] LACK_OF_CPU
```

## Why does it occur?

This issue occurs when your application is using more CPU than is available. This can happen when your application is under heavy load, or when your application is not optimized to use less CPU.

## How to fix

The CPU allocated to your application is determined by your current plan. To address this, consider upgrading to a higher plan on the [plans page](https://squarecloud.app/pricing). Alternatively, optimize your application to reduce CPU usage.

### Resubmitting your application

After upgrading your plan, it's important to remove your application and resubmit it to reflect the updated CPU allocation.
